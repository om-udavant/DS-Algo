     * Nightking wants to attack the kingdom and he really likes cold days.
     * However, he doesnâ€™t want to attack the kingdom on the coldest day, because it is obvious.
     * Instead, he will attack the second coldest day. Given an array A of N distinct integers where
     * Ai represents the temperature forecast of the i-th day, You need to find the temperature of the day of the attack.
